# About me

I am a Data Engineer passionate about data management and software engineering. Over the past 4 years, I've helped more than 120 professionals tackle complex data challenges and optimize data systems. With a dual degree in management and data, I bring a cross-functional perspective that seamlessly blends strategic insight with technical expertise.

I also have a strong interest in machine learning and AI, and many of my repositories feature tutorials as part of my training activities. Currently, I am developing a project called Fiscalia, which aims to offer practical advice on tax and accounting for french independent professionals.
