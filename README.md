# About me

I am a Data Engineer passionate about managing and optimizing data systems while tackling complex challenges. Over the past 4 years, I've helped over 150 professionals enhance their Azure-based data infrastructures. My dual degree in marketing and data provides a cross-functional perspective that bridges strategic insights with technical excellence.

I also have a strong interest in machine learning and AI, and many of my repositories feature tutorials as part of my training activities. Currently, I am developing a project called Fiscalia, which aims to offer practical advice on tax and accounting for independent professionals.
